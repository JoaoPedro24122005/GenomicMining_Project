Steps

1) Finding the thermophilic taxons of bacteria and archaea

Before searching for the genomes of thermophilic organisms in the database, we first need to identify which ones 
are thermophilic. To do this, we need to find a reference (in the database, in articles, etc.) that confirms 
this information. Unfortunately, databases (such as GenBank) do not have a label indicating whether the genome 
belongs to a thermophilic organism or not. The solution is to use sources in the literature or the Isolation 
source, which can indicate whether the organism's habitat is characterized by extreme temperatures or not, to 
find them.

The solution is to use the Isolation Source, but is only informed in metadatas of the genomes on GTDB, not in NCBI.

Using words in the Isolation Source thermal, hydrothermal...

Besides that, we can search for articles about thermophilic organisms, mainly articles of large sequencing 
project, like Earth BioGenome Project (EBP) [19] and Genomes from Earth's Microbiomes (GEM) [20] or others 
articles about taxonomy reclassification

1.1) Using Literature

Articles [X-Y] was used to find the taxons of different bacteria and archaeas that were thermophilic. For genus 
that have most of the members being thermophilic, the whole genus was considered for the search, not just the 
species cited
